# Hopf-Visualisation
A visualisation of the Hopf Fibration, which is a mathematical mapping betweem the three dimensional sphere and the four dimensional sphere.
This project will help to visualise and interact with the Hopf fibration, in order for one to understand its properties and its beauty.

<b>Unity</b><br>
By creating procedurally generated meshes, it can generate a wide range of values given as long as it can be rendered by the graphics card. Tubes will be drawn to represent the fibre itself.

<b>Oculus</b><br>
The application is designed to be used on the Oculus Rift. Enhances the experience a user can have to fully understand the Hopf fibration and its properties. It can also be run on a 3D TV or translated to any other 3D device that converges the left and right images.

<b>Colour</b><br>
To represent a value that may not have been feasible to show on a 2D display can now be shown on a 3D display to visualise elements of the four dimensional sphere without only using colour to distinguish the layer. Colour can now be used as another property to represent other properties of the S3 (hypersphere).
